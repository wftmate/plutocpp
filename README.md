# pluto
for trying to get pluto sdr to work with libiio on windows and linux

so far this works well on linux with the files included here.

It will compline fine on windows using the MinGW32 .dll files provided by Analog Devices.

Current Issues:
Windows development in Eclipse only works with MinGW32. Cant get it to compile for 64 bit processors.
